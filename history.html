            <h1>History of Tetris</h1>
            <p>The history of teris is interesting. The creator was Alexey Pajitnov. He originally created the game <br>
                on a massive mainframe computer. He based the game off of some of the puzzels he liked as a kid,<br>
                but made modifications when the game got really boring. The game was technicaly owned by the soviet union<br>
                but Pajitnov eventually got ownership of the game.
